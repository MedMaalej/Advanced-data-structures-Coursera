# Advanced-data-structures-Coursera
This repository contains my work during the course offered by Coursera and the University of San diego California. This course assignments are using Java. It builds a strong foundation for the graphs data structures and algorithms. I'm so grateful to the University of San Diego California for giving me this free, rich and valuable learning opportunity.
